## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(RWeka)
library(caret)
wine.all <- read.csv("winequalityN.csv")

###### analysis ######

head(wine.all)
summary(wine.all)


### baseline model ####
wine.all$quality <- as.factor(wine.all$quality)
wine.train <- wine.all[1:3248, ]
wine.test <- wine.all[3249:6497, ]
model.wine.raw <- J48(quality ~ ., data = wine.train)
prediction.wine.raw <- predict(model.wine.raw, newdata = wine.test)
references.wine.raw <- wine.test$quality

confmat.wine.raw <- table(prediction.wine.raw, references.wine.raw)
accuracy.wine.raw <- sum(diag(confmat.wine.raw)) / sum(confmat.wine.raw)
accuracy.wine.raw

```
